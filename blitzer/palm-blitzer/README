This is the first release of palm-blitzer, a port of blitzer to the
palm pilot.

The script pbDB.py can be used to import files into the blitzer DB.
You'll need the Pyrite package installed to use it.  Remember to run
blitzer at least once before running pbDB.

There's still no verify option.  I'm too lazy.  It Works Well Enough
For Me.

This is still unstable.  Be careful.
